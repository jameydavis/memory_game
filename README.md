# Memory Game

This is the code for the assignment to create a memory game in Swift. 

The app has 2 views, a lobby view and a gameplay view.

The lobby view allows you to select from 4 grids if various rows and columns for the card layout.

The gameplay view allows you to select pairs of cards to check if they match. If a match is found 
the cards will remain upright. If there is not a match the cards will flip over again.

The game is over when all matches have been found.
